How did viewing a diff between two verions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	it narrowed down the hunting of bug to the lines of code that were changed instead of whole file.

how could having easy access to the entire history of the file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	because this way we can compare any old version to current or restore if needed to certain point in history.

what do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vd having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

		Pros:
			- provide logical compilable commits.
			- gives control to person to decide when to commit hence encourging not to small and not to big commits
		Cons:
			- manual error prone.
